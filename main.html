            <h1>What is food culture?</h1>
            <p>The definition of food culture can be described as the <em>, attitudes, and practices related to producing and consuming food</em>.

                That may sound a bit dry, but what it means is that food culture lies at the heart of our relationship with our food and the food systems that produce and deliver it to us.
                
                Because food is such an important part of our heritage and ethnicity, traditional foods and recipes play a key role in our food culture. When we sit down with friends and family to enjoy a meal together, we are literally ‘breaking bread’ with them.
                
                On a subconscious level, we/'re tapping into centuries of food cultures and traditions.</p>
